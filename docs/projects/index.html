        This was my first full stack app where I used React in the frontend. There's a lot of good AND bad practices inside the code, since I developed the app while I was learning React (though I knew all the basic stuff). It started from a common scenenario every group of friends have lived: where to go to dinner? next place to have some drinks? which game to play this night? or even when there's a need for a general agreement over a discussed topic. With this app you create a poll, add some questions and options and share a link easily with your friends. Visualize answers as they arrive. Users get the poll's results on their emails! (this part was rough since gmail flags everything as spam!)
        Stack: react (typescript), express, mongodb

        I wanted to learn Angular, but I had nothing in mind. A friend of mine, which is a doctor, wanted to publish medical courses in exchange of a pay. I designed this app where you can structure courses' contents, including a video. I gained a lot of knowledge here: streaming data --videos-- from cloud storage buckets, connect payment APIs and the Angular framework itself.
        Stack: typescript, angular, express with zod validations and postgresql with kysely querybuilder+migration manager (100% typesafe!)

        I used Twitter a lot when I was a teenager, so obviously I wanted to create a clone of that app (which sadly became "X"). Though it is not finished I learned a lot about the Go language as a backend programming language. I liked working with it..
        Stack: react (typescript) and react query, golang with just the native http multiplexer! and postgresql.

        Besides that- you can look up many projects created with Java Springboot, which is a framework I used extensively during my stay in college and some basic side projects, alongside with Vue2/3 (never gets old). So... I can say I like Java too! Specifically, Springboot has everything you need to write resilient backends, and Vue always works, though I'd prefer Angular and React anytime.
